# Challenge 13 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

This application is designed to allow tracking products, categories and product tags through an E-commerce back end application.

## Installation

Prior to use of this application, the user must have installed node.js and npm inquirer and PostgreSQL, and Sequelize

## Usage

THis application will allow the getting of product information, and will also allow the adding, deleting and updating of product information.  It will be tested by using Insomnia to show the ability to GET all data from the database through the correct routes, and the same method will be used to perform API POST, PUT and DELETE operations through the appropriate routes.

## Status
At this time, the database has been created, seeded, and should be working, but is not.  There have been many Sequelize errors that have been fixed, and I still have not been able to resolve them as of now.  The latest error is shown below.  I'm using Postman, because my Insomnia has not been working.  I've uninstalled and reinstalled twice, and it continues to hang on start, accepting no keyboard input.
